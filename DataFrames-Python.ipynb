In fact, it is has been estimated that data scientists spend 80% of their time preparing data. This process of integrating and filtering data is commonly know as data munging. \n","\n","This notebook contains exercises in using the Pandas package for data munging.

point you may be wondering about how and when to use the `loc` and `iloc` methods. To add to the story there is the `ix` method. In simple terms these methods can be summarized as:\n","\n","- The **`loc`** method allows subsetting a Pandas data frame by the labels (names) of rows and columns. Rows and columns can be spcified in a list, or by a range with a stride using the `:` operator. Note that the default row indices are integers starting at `0`.\n","- The **`iloc`** method allows subsetting a Pandas data frame using zero based integer positioning of rows and columns. Rows and columns can be spcified in a list, or by a range and stride using the `:` operator. \n","- The **`ix`** method is a hybrid between `loc` and `iloc`. The indices can be the labels or the integer positions. While this flexibility can be useful, be careful when using  `ix`. There can be some ambiguity between labels and integer positions, particularly when using the default row and column labels.\n","\n","Specifing ranges of rows and  columns with `loc` and `iloc` following a similar convention to that used for the data frame `[]` operator:\n","\n","$$DataFrame.iloc[row-start\\ : row-end\\ : row-stride,\\ column-start: column-end: column-stride]$$\n","\n","Keep this convention in mind when doing any of these operations. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Random sample a data frame\n","\n","Data scientists often need randomly chosen subsets of data.
